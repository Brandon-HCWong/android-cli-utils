# android-cli-utils
This repository is a collection of command-line utilities created to streamline Android development tasks.

These scripts were written to solve specific problems I encountered during work, so they might not be universally useful â€” but I hope they can still offer some value.

If you have any suggestions or ideas for improvement, feel free to open an issue or reach out. I truly appreciate your feedback!
